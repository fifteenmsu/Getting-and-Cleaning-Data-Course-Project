# Cook Book
This Cook Book describes input data and result tidy dataset together with all steps to create result.
Create–≤ by Pavel Grebennikov in accordance with task of programming assignment for Getting and Clearing Data Course Project.

## Input Data
Input Data [the directory UCI HAR Dataset/...] consist of train and test parts [subdirectories ./train and ./test] containing three files each:
1. X_train.txt or [X_test.txt] - all data available for analysis.
2. subject_train.txt [or subject_test.txt] - ids of persons took part in the experiment. 
3. y_train.txt [or y_test.txt] - activity number corresponding to particular time interval of study (i.e. 1,2,3 .. 6) 

Additionally in the root directory [UCI HAR Dataset/...] the following file can be found:
1. features.txt - list of all variables available for analysis.
  * The full details of the input variable can be get from README.txt and Feature_info.txt files in the root directory, also helpfull information provided here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and 
2. activity_labels.txt - names of numbered activities (i.e. sitting, laying, walking, etc.)

## Result Data / Code Book
Result data (file tidy.txt) is written to root directory. it contains the following columns:
1. subject - id of person whose data were recorded during experiment.
2. derived variables (all have no unit - have been normalized to [-1, 1]):
  * variables in the result data set are _AVG_ of original variables and have the following name  notation {orig_var}-{mean()|std()}-[{X|Y|Z}].{activity}, where
   +  {orig_var} one of the following: 
tBodyAcc tGravityAcc tBodyAccJerk tBodyGyro tBodyGyroJerk tBodyAccMag tGravityAccMag  tBodyAccJerkMag tBodyGyroMag tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc fBodyAccJerk fBodyGyro fBodyAccMag fBodyAccJerkMag fBodyGyroMag fBodyGyroJerkMag
   + {mean()|std()} - only mean and std was used in the task.
   + [{X|Y|Z}] - axes of measure (where apropriate)
   + {activity} -  name of activity for which AVG of current variable was calculated.

## Study Design
The following approach was used to prepare tidy data:
1. Import data to R from delimeted files and assing columns names - train and test parts separetely.
2. Append train and test parts.
3. Add names of activities instead of numbers (join-like)
4. Keep only variables corresponding to mean and std of measures.
5. Create dataset with 1 row per subject with columns are AVg of each variable "withing" each activity.
